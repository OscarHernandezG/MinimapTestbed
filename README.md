## What is a minimap

A minimap is a miniature map that is usually placed at a corner of the screen to help players orient thmselves and manage to control what's happening outside his field of view. In a minimap the common features are the entities position (maybe only player entities or player and enemy entities) and objectives nearby as well as the sorrounding topography.
